# Project Architecture

This document captures the high-level structure, naming rules, and conventions for the *Health-Stats* code-base.

## 1. Directory Layout

```
.
├─ infra/                # Deployment + operational tooling (never imported by the app)
│  ├─ aws/               # CloudFormation / Lambda helpers
│  └─ scripts/           # One-off migration & data scripts
├─ public/               # Static assets served by Next.js
├─ src/
│  ├─ app/               # Next.js App-Router tree (pages, route handlers, RSC)
│  │  └─ api/            # HTTP route handlers only (no business logic)
│  ├─ components/        # Re-usable UI components (client + server)
│  │  └─ ui/             # Low-level primitives (Card, Skeleton, Dialog…)
│  ├─ features/          # Domain-specific hooks, utils, and small components
│  ├─ lib/               # Back-end helpers grouped by domain
│  │  ├─ auth/           # Authentication helpers / adapters
│  │  ├─ db/             # Database clients & queries
│  │  ├─ aws/            # S3, Lambda helpers used at runtime
│  │  └─ payments/       # Stripe utilities
│  └─ types/             # Shared domain and API types (no ambient declarations)
├─ types/                # Ambient global .d.ts for third‑party modules (picked up via typeRoots)
└─ docs/                 # Internal documentation (you are here)
```

### Rules

1. **No business logic inside `src/app/api`.**  Route handlers are thin.  Real work lives in `src/lib/…` or `src/features/…`.
2. **All directories are lowercase-kebab-case**, except Next.js dynamic segments (e.g. `[userId]`).
3. **Files use PascalCase** for React components, `camelCase` for helpers.

---

## 2. Path Aliases (tsconfig.json)

```jsonc
"paths": {
  "@/*":            ["./src/*"],
  "@components/*":  ["./src/components/*"],
  "@features/*":    ["./src/features/*"],
  "@lib/*":         ["./src/lib/*"]
}
```
Use these instead of long relative paths.

---

## 3. Types

- `types/` (repo root): Ambient declarations only (e.g., NextAuth module augmentation, third‑party `.d.ts`). These are discovered via `typeRoots` in `tsconfig.json`.
- `src/types/`: Domain and API types used across the app (interfaces, unions, DTOs). No ambient declarations here.

---
### Plain‑English: why two "types" places?

- Root `types/` → think "tell TypeScript about libraries". Holds ambient `.d.ts` files that extend or describe third‑party modules. You don't import these; TypeScript finds them automatically.
- `src/types/` → think "our app's shapes". Regular `.ts` files you import everywhere for domain models and DTOs.
- `.next/types/` → generated by Next.js during build. Temporary helper types; never edit. We include it in `tsconfig` so Next.js' internals type-check correctly.
- There is no `src/app/types` in this project. If it appears, it's likely leftover and should be removed.

---

## 4. Component Guidelines

* Prefer **server components**; mark client components explicitly with `'use client'`.
* One component per file; export named components.
* Keep story/tests adjacent (`MyComp.test.tsx`, `MyComp.stories.tsx`).

---

## 5. Back-end Utilities (`src/lib`)

Each sub-folder owns a public API via an `index.ts` barrel.  Example pattern:

```ts
// src/lib/db/index.ts
export * from './mongodb';
```

Callers then `import { getDb } from '@lib/db';`.

---

## 6. Styling & UI

* **Tailwind CSS** with a mobile-first approach.
* Radix UI + Shadcn for accessible primitives.
* Use utility classes; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.

---

## 7. Testing

* Jest + React Testing Library.
* Tests live next to code (e.g. `TrendIndicator.test.tsx`).

---

## 8. Scripts & Infrastructure

* All operational scripts live in `infra/scripts`.
* Cloud resources (Lambda bundle, policies) under `infra/aws`.

---

## 9. Adding a New Feature

1. Create a folder in `src/features` (`kebab-case`).
2. Add hooks, utils, and small components there.
3. If you need API endpoints, add route handlers under `src/app/api/feature-name`.
4. Expose helper functions in `src/lib/feature-name` when necessary.
